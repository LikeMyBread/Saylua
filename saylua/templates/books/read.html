      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p>
        I loved Eydruns. They were always staring at me when I traveled in the woods of
        Luaria. I could see their glowing yellow eyes from the dark caves. Lights would
        flicker on and off the rocky walls as they blinked.

        I never got too close to them though. Their glowing eyes were beautiful, but I heard
        they were dangerous. I could hear them though - a call a bit like a slow, high whine.
        Melancholic and melodic, I was attracted to their voice.

        I knew I had to stay away though. They told stories of their glares. They say no one
        has ever returned from seeing an Eydrun stare at them with all of their eyes at once.
