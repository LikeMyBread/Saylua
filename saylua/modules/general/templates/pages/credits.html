<h1>Saylua Credits</h1>
<p>
  Although Saylua was primarily created by Mike and Tiff, the game would not
  have been possible without the contributions of many
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the art for Saylua, including the pet art, was wonderfully drawn by
  <a href="http://www.chutkat.com/">Chutkat</a> who also designed the overall
  visual style for the site.
</p>
<p>
  The world of Saylua was brought to life through the beautiful environment
  illustrations of <a href="http://lyraina.com">Lyraina</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The logo for Saylua was created by <a href="http://irianwhitefox.deviantart.com/">
  IrianWhitefox</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Many early programming contributions to the project were created by
  <a href="http://noisek.com/">Noi Sek</a> who particularly helped with
  getting our Adventure feature off the ground.
</p>
<p>
  Several additional artists including <a href="http://fyne.deviantart.com/">Fyne</a>,
  <a href="https://synthaphonograph.tumblr.com/">Synthaphonograph</a>,
  <a href="https://cheetahtrout.tumblr.com/">Cheetahtrout</a>,
  <a href="http://ravna-resta.deviantart.com/">Ravna-Resta</a>,
  and <a href="http://fasius.deviantart.com/">Fasius</a> contributed artwork
  early on in the project's life.
</p>
<p>
  Much of Saylua's lore was expanded upon through writing contributions from
  <a href="http://theartsyaxolotl.com/">ArtsyAxolotl</a>.
</p>
<p>
  And a special thanks to the early members of the project who helped
  shape the direction of Saylua with their feedback, ideas, and encouragement:
  Namine, Gam, Tears, Inu, Vik, and Queenie.
