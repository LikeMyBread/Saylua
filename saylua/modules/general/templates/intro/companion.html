<h1>Your Companion</h1>
<p>
  Your adventure into {{ g.user.side_name() }} will be an exciting one full of
  discovery and challenges. Of course, you won't be going alone. Few in the
  world of Saylua adventure far without a companion at their side.
</p>
<p>
  The planet of Saylua is home to many creatures. And in time, you
  will come to meet a large variety of them. But your story begins with just one
  companion who will accompany as you journey into {{ g.user.side_name() }}.
</p>
