<h1>Starting Your Journey</h1>
<p>
  It was time for you to head out for the next chapter of your life. You were
  ready to move closer to the countryside, a place where you could be closer to
  nature.
</p>
<p>
  The planet of Saylua is divided into two main sides, a dark side and a light
  side. Both sides have their own draws, and you can choose to live in either.
</p>
<h3>
  Which side will you choose?
</h3>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-element-half">
    <img src="{{ include_static('img/backgrounds/sayleus.png') }}" />
    Sayleus, the light side
  </div>
  <div class="grid-element-half">
    <img src="{{ include_static('img/backgrounds/luaria.png') }}" />
    Luaria, the dark side
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Of course, you shouldn't worry too much if you regret your decision down the
  road. It will always be possible for you to move again.
