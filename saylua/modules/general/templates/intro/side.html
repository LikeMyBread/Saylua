<h1>Starting Your Journey</h1>
<p>
  It was time for you to head out for the next chapter of your life. You were
  ready to move closer to the countryside, a place where you could be closer to
  nature.
</p>
<p>
  The planet of Saylua is divided into two main sides, a dark side and a light
  side. Both sides have their own draws, and you can choose to live in either.
</p>
<h3>
  Which side will you choose?
</h3>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-element-half" id="sayleus">
    <a href="#sayleus">
      <img src="{{ include_static('img/backgrounds/sayleus.jpg') }}" />
      Sayleus, the light side
    </a>
    <p>
      In Sayleus, vivid meadows often transition into deep woods where the light
      shines brightly through the trees. The light side is home to many large,
      thriving plants and elegant creatures. Of course, being constantly hit by
      the sun's rays isn't always cheery. On the further ends of Sayleus, there
      are vast deserts where humans and creatures alike struggle to survive in
      the harsh heat of the light.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-element-half" id="luaria">
    <a href="#luaria">
      <img src="{{ include_static('img/backgrounds/luaria.jpg') }}" />
      Luaria, the dark side
    </a>
    <p>
      The endless darkness that covers Luaria has made the hemisphere a
      challenging place for humans to live. Luckily, Luariaâ€™s history has left
      it blessed with many strong sources of magic. This dark side is covered
      in bioluminescent plants that have adapted to absorb magical energy in
      the absence of light.
    </p>

<p>
  Of course, you shouldn't worry too much if you regret your decision down the
  road. It will always be possible for you to move again.
